I hit 10,000 TikTok followers today. Normally, I donâ€™t make a big deal out of this stuff. But, this feels like quite an accomplishment given the dramatic shift Iâ€™ve made.

It would be safe to say that six months ago, this would have been laughable. I wasnâ€™t active on TikTok, and I detested everything about it (and short-form video generally). But, by the end of September, I put my old man shoes away and realized that this was something I needed to do.

When I committed to it, I made a conscious decision to become the most followed account related to the topic of Facebook ads on TikTok. Iâ€™m obviously not there yet, but this is a nice milestone.

What I did was simple and complicated at the same time. It really comes down to two thingsâ€¦

The bad: I tried really hard to target precisely to build my audience with relevant people. All indications are that this wasnâ€™t successful. It was mostly numbers padding (the relevant followers would come organically).

The good: We can knock vanity metrics all we want, but it does mean something on TikTok if someone has a following. It surely helped convince some relevant people that I was worth following.

Did this lead to a significant spike in engagement during those first few months? Not really. But I do think that it helped me reach the next step.

A Dedicated Commitment to Create

Look, I could run ads forever on TikTok, but unless I was actually creating good content, it would not matter. I dedicated myself early.

I would create bad videos in the beginning, there was no avoiding that. But the goal was to get myself out of that phase as quickly as possible. I created 70 videos in October. It was a difficult, challenging, and inefficient month of video creation.

But it was worth it. I started to figure out my process. I found a workflow. Needs like software and lighting became clearer to me.

I dedicated myself to publishing at least one video per day in 2023. Truthfully, I missed very few days once I started in October, but I wanted to avoid any days off going forward.

Iâ€™ve kept to that commitment and Iâ€™ve published more than 260 videos on TikTok. Consistency, volume, and quality. More than anything else, Iâ€™d say that these were the keys to my growth.

What I Didnâ€™t Do

I didnâ€™t try to go viral. I didnâ€™t worry about trends or popular sounds. Trust me, youâ€™re going to hear a lot of advice around that stuff.

But itâ€™s wrong.

If all you care about is being popular, sure. Chase that stuff. But youâ€™re going to attract a very general, random audience. And thatâ€™s not how you build an engaged following around a specialty.

While I havenâ€™t completely niched down on TikTok (I talk about Facebook ads, video creation, and entrepreneurship), itâ€™s at least a similar category. I donâ€™t want to attract randos who donâ€™t care about any of these things.

The result: Engagement is growing with the audience size.

Tracking Growth

as far as I can tell. But even within the past two months, the improvement really jumps out.

Those spikes are when some videos took off. I have three recent videos that received more than 30,000 views (all organic).

Those three videos alone resulted in 2,942 new followers.

But itâ€™s not just those three. Hereâ€™s a look at the trend of views during the past 60 daysâ€¦

Even during the end of January, most days Iâ€™d receive very few views. But then something started to change. The floor raised.

Engagement is no longer focused on a few videos. I can now expect that my recent videos will almost always get at least 1,000 views. That was definitely not the case before.

That doesnâ€™t mean that this new engagement level will continue forever, but itâ€™s certainly a good sign.! sdf
